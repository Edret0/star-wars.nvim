# Introduction 

This is a color theme plugin that I created in order to see how neovim stores
colors. This is not an orignal idea as this theme is similar to a theme 
in the Visual Studio Code extensions called [Star Wars Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NiravAgarwal.star-wars-theme)

To apply the theme run the following command.
    "colortheme star-wars"
